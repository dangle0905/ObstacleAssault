## What was implemented
* Object Oriented Programming with C++. Member variables, functions, child classes.
* Making get object velocity to be view on a slower computer and a faster computer to be the same by multiplying by DeltaTime
* Fixing Drift (situation where we go over our target value) 
* FString, FVector, FRotator
* Debugging with Output log
* UPROPERTY and UE_LOG
* Bluprint and child classes of C++
* Using const for program safety
* Using functions in Unreal to get normal of object, get rotation..etc.
* Practices for readable code.
